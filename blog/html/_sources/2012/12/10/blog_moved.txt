I've just moved my blog from http://robert-zaremba-it.posterous.com/. I migrate most of the content. Here you can find my new posts.

The blog was redesigned. It is based on my previous blog. Big thanks to `Marta Zaremba <http://martazaremba.wix.com/human-space>`_ who makes the final design, which is so cool (at least for me).

Previously I used http://posterous.com platform for blogging. But since twitter bought it there was no development and progress in the palatform.
