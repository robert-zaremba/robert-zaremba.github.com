What do you think about this statement?

    We Need Fewer Product Managers.

John Cutler recently published an `article <https://hackernoon.com/we-need-fewer-product-managers-50e47dfd95a0>`_ with same title.

Later, the author clarifies:

    This post has been brewing as I interact with more and more companies struggling to define (and scale) product “management” in increasingly complex organizations.

Personally I can't agree more. We need more clearly defined roles and doers.

.. more::

Many project manager acts as a middle man. Instead of empowering and training the team enterprises create "magically fill the completely unreasonable and scattered roles.

Let me put my statement here:


We need more DOERS and team COACHERS.
-------------------------------------


The team should be responsible to define the work-plan, present delivery, design solution and have leaders (also doers) mature enough who will call for necessary training and verification whenever it's needed.

Product managers produce less quality than self organized teams because even a good listener will not be able to coordinate all the small things that go into a great product where every domain specialist can contribute there sense of quality.

This doesn't mean that we don't need product owners and representatives. We do. And let me repeat: **we need well qualified, well structurized product owners**. But we can't magically make the work done with amorphous product managers / owners or focusing on the management side rather than doing side.
