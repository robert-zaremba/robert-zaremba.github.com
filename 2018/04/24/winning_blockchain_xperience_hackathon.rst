We did it!
----------

I was honored to lead the winning team of the Blockchain Xperience Hackathon @ Oracle [1]_ [2]_, part of the `Open Geneva Festival <https://opengeneva.org/en/>`_.

Our project, **DEX Escrow**, aimed to provide a solution for deferred money transfers where the funds are locked under management of financial institutions.

The DEX Escrow project was following my Escrow Protocol research for the SIX hackathon, where he was I was pitching an idea of inter-banking systems. The project was highlighted and go into the SIX finals (among 5 other teams).

Many thanks to our Blockchain Xperience team:

+ Guillaume Goutaudier
+ RaphaÃ«l Vieira
+ Pierre Guiol
+ Myself ;)

I'm honored (and thankful) for Guillaume testimony he provided to Oracle:

*"When Robert suggested to build up a team for the Oracle Hackaton,   I immediately accepted the challenge. I had previous experiences  working on public blockchains (mainly Ethereum), but wanted to explore use cases where having a "permissioned" Blockchain would  make more sense. From this perspective, the DEX escrow protocol was a nice opportunity to work on a solution where there is a limited number of participants, and where the reliance on a 3d party could  be replaced by a Blockchain."*

SIX F10 Hackathon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, earlier in March I was researching and pitching more advanced concept - the InterBank Escrow Protocol. With my friend, Cyril Lapinte, who provided a great banking support, we went into finals and got a spotlight!

Team: Cyril Lapinte & Me.
