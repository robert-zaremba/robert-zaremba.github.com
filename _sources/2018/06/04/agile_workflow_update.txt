Building a team and setting up the project on rails is a lot of challenges. That's the main reason why Agile Methodologies are on the table all and over again.

Having some time for reflection and going over more tools and processes I've updated my `Agile Workflow <http://bit.ly/agile-workflow>`_ - essay for an efficient work methodology.

The update includes:

+ The value of customer targeting, both for the project teams and marketing.
+ Value of CRM tools.
+ Analytics.
+ The Lean Startup key points (by Eric Ries).
+ Site Reliability Engineering (all together with SLO, SLI, SLA).
+ Design thinking.

Hope you will find some inspiration from it. Have a good reading!
