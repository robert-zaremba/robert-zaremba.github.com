I have a long experience with startups: form being the first employee in a startup, partnerships, setting up own startups, advising and mentoring. I won few hackathons and gained lot of very valuable experience. `Business Canvas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas>`_ is present at almost every hackathon. Today I'm writing about the central point - startup idea and market validation.

However this one is a bit different - it's shaped toward blockchain products.

Token Problems
--------------

When designing a token based product we need to clearly look at the intend of the token, especially if it will represent a value.

I described some of the major problem which may arise when constructing valuable tokens are in the `Token Economics: Token Design problems & classification </2019/04/23/token_economics__token_design_problems___classification.html>`_ article.

In a nutshell we need to deal with the following subjects: speculative intent, regulatory implications, network deanonymization, risk of market irrationality, stakeholder alignment.
