=======================

I decided to continue my blog using Facebook Pages. Please follow me at:  `www.facebook.com/robert.zaremba.scale.it <https://www.facebook.com/robert.zaremba.scale.it>`_.

The main reasons:

+ It's easier and faster to publish.
+ Convenience for creating a quick posts with photos using mobile.
+ Convenience for uploading videos.
+ Facebook Notes just works for creating nice posts (`example <https://www.facebook.com/notes/robert-zaremba-information-technology-expert/moving-remote-work-to-the-next-level/2574505885898982/>`_)
+ Social networks effect - easier to share / follow.
+ FB Pages works for people who don't have FB account.

One may ask about privacy. My blog is public!
