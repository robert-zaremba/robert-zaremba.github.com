  My work interests are about data mining, maths, physics, IT and programming pearls.
  In my daily work I'm developing:

* data / web mining

applications to IT systems.

I'm **Python** programming mastering and enthusiast in programming with:

* `Julia <http://julialang.org>`_

Recently I was supporting `asseco <http://asseco.com/pl/home-en/>`_ (one of the biggest IT company in Europe) where I was developing a cloud system (based on OpenStack). I also built a system for context advertising network company - `BussinesClick <http://www.businessclick.com/>`_ which is used to match right person with relevant content.

Moreover I'm programming some social portals (`expressYa <http://expressya.com>`_).
